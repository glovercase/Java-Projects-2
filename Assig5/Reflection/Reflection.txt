For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?
I got stuck with the sorted arraySet and I wasn’t thinking straight about what was required and had to change my code so it used binary search. But I got there in the end. I found the tree recursion quite tricky it doesn’t look the same as the demo but going with a symmetrical looking tree. I really enjoy recursion. 


Some of the recursive algorithms in this assignment could have been written
just as easily using simple loops.

Which recursive methods could have been easily written with loops?

All tail recursion can, The stepping stone.

What are the advantage(s) or disadvantage(s) of using recursive methods 
rather than loops.

Advantages - easier to read as a programmer , More elegant than a bunch of nested loops

Disadvantage - every time a recursive call is made the stack increases, it could potentially crash the stack if the operation is to large. 
Why couldn't the others be easily written with loops?
Because the others are calling the method multiple times to make a change it would be tricky make multiple loops to do the same required work.  


Many people find recursion hard to understand at first, although it doesn't do
anything different from previous programs - it just involves methods which call
methods.  Why is it tricky?

I guess because the method calls itself, so you might not understand how it increments they may think it is just going to do the same thing over and over.
