COMP 103 Assignment 5
Report on SortedArraySet testing and benchmarking

Name: Casey Glover

Testing:
Which test methods succeeded or failed on your implementation of SortedArraySet:
 All tests passed but I wasn’t using binary search, and only adding to the end of the array. so therefore it was becoming unsorted. 

Some reason my add method doesn’t work properly 






Performance Benchmarking:
What were the results of your timing tests?
(Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for 
  - SortedArraySet, ArraySet, and HashSet.
  - dictionaryUnsorted.txt and dictionarySorted.txt 

Sorted ArraySet

Loading took: 0.474 seconds
Checking took: 15.661 seconds

HashSet 

Loading took: 0.579 seconds
Checking took: 0.819 seconds

ArraySet took: 
Loading took: 133.487 seconds
Checking took: 89 seconds
