For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got on this assignment. If there was a problem you got stuck on what was that problem?
I managed to complete this assignment I am really enjoying the problem solving. The hardest method for me to solve was the find ancestors first off I was using recursion but I kept getting a null pointer exception. I then switched to the iterative approach. The contains method also took a wee while to get working but got there in the end. For the challenge the color coding was a neat way to make it look more visually appealing. 

* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

This is because the children are put into a hash set which naturally donâ€™t preserve order.  There is no easy way to predict what order the elements will come out. To change the HashSet to a LinkedHashSet would be a good option to have an ordering.

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.

It could detach from the tree. The children become the parent or the grandparent. Could have memory issues in the program.
