Report on ArraySet testing and benchmarking

Name: Casey Glover

Testing:
Which test methods succeeded or failed on your implementation of ArraySet:

All of the the tests succeeded. It took time to figure out what to fix. 


Benchmarking :
What were the results of your timing tests?
(Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for both
ArraySet and HashSet.)

HashSet: time to load dictionary 450 milliseconds.

Time to load the hamlet story 4215 milliseconds. 

ArraySet: time to load dictionary 220223 milliseconds.

Time to load the hamlet story 162032 milliseconds.

The array set is rubbish compared to the hash set.
