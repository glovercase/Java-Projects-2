COMP 103 Assignment 4 

Is the queue fair: 

After running the thread multiple times, The results for the consumer changed significantly which suggests that the queue isnâ€™t fair.
If the queue of consumers get too far behind producers then the producers are naturally throttled since they have to wait to add more elements.

The general rules for fair queueing is FIFO. There might be someone/something with priority over another, therefore they may need to jump to the front of the queue. For example a medical queue a person having a heart attack will have a higher priority than someone with a broken arm.
